HelpViewApp README
==================

This simple app can display the sample `documentation_project` in Apple’s Help
Viewer application, and demonstrates how you might integrate _Middlemac_ with
your Xcode project.

It consists of the following targets:

`HelpViewerApp (free)`

  : The “free” version of this application will display the `:free` target in
    the Help Viewer.

`HelpViewerApp (pro)`

  : The “pro” version of this application will display the `:pro` target in the
    Help Viewer.
