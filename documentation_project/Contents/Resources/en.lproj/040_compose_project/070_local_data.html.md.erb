title:  Local Data
blurb:  You can use a local file as a datasource to generate data-based pages
        automatically. Learn how in this section.

<%= md_links %>
<%= md_images %>

<%= current_page.data.blurb %>

You can use data from external sources with _Middleman_ and _Middlemac_, too.
These data files must be in YAML or JSON format, and be present in
`SharedGlobalAssets/_data/`.

This project contains sample in YAML format called `globals.yml`. Let’s see
what it contains:

~~~ yaml
famous_writers:
  -
    author: Douglas Adams
    sample_work: The Restaurant at the End of the Universe
  -
    author: Edward Bulwer-Lytton
    sample_work: Paul Clifford
  -
    author: Daniel Defoe
    sample_work: Robinson Crusoe
~~~

We can use this data to build something more interesting. Let’s try this:

<% data.globals.famous_writers.each do |writer| %>
- A sample work of <%= writer.author %> is _<%= writer.sample_work %>_.
<% end %>

These previous sentences were generated with this ERB code:

~~~ erb
<%% data.globals.famous_writers.each do |writer| %>
- A sample work of <%%= writer.author %> is _<%%= writer.sample_work %>_.
<%% end %>
~~~


Accessing data
--------------

This data is available to you via `data.file_name.top_level_key`.
