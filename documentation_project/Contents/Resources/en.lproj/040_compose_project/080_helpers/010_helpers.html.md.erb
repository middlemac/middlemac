Helpers are methods that return a string, typically a snippet of HTML code, or
sometimes a value that can be used with ERB. This page highlights some of the
helpers available in _Middleman_ and added via _Middlemac_.


_Middleman_ helpers
-------------------

_Middleman_ has several useful, built-in helpers documented on its 
[web site](http://middlemanapp.com/basics/helper_methods/). These are some of
the most common ones you will use.

`link_to`

 : This helper greatly simplifies links when you’re not able or willing to use
   Markdown links.
   
   ~~~ erb
   <%%= link_to 'Content text', 'http://example.com' %>
   ~~~
   
   ~~~ erb
   <%= link_to 'Content text', 'http://example.com' %>
   ~~~
   
   You can even use a _Middleman_ resource for the second parameter:
   
   ~~~ erb
   <%%= link_to 'Main Page', current_page.breadcrumbs.first %>
   ~~~

   ~~~ erb
   <%= link_to 'Main Page', current_page.breadcrumbs.first %>
   ~~~
   
   And you can specify one or more attributes like so:
   
   ~~~ erb
   <%%= link_to 'test', '#', :title => 'test' , :'data-test' => 'data attribute test' %>
   ~~~

   ~~~ erb
   <%= link_to 'test', '#', :title => 'test' , :'data-test' => 'data attribute test' %>
   ~~~
   

`image_tag`

 : This helper simplifies adding images to your documents. It knows the location
   of your images if you’ve followed the conventions.
   
   ~~~ erb
   <%%= image_tag 'all-sample' %>
   ~~~

   <%= image_tag 'all-sample', :figure => false %>
      
   You can also specify attributes:
   
   ~~~ erb
   <%%= image_tag 'all-sample', :alt => 'A murder of crows', :title => 'Birds' %>
   ~~~
   
   <%= image_tag 'all-sample', :alt => 'A murder of crows', :title => 'Birds', :figure => false %>
   
   Although these two examples describe _Middleman_’s built-in `image_tag`
   helper, _Middlemac_ can extend this functionality even more. 


`content_for`

 : The built-in templates include an area for “See Also” where you might want to
   include links in addition to the automatically generated links. You can do
   this with the `contentfor` helper.
   
   ~~~ erb
   <%% content_for :seeAlso do %>
   <%%= link_to 'Some interesting site', 'http://example.com' %>
   <%% end %>
   ~~~

   As you get more advanced with your use of _Middleman_, you will certainly
   think of more uses for this.

Helpers that Middlemac Overrides
--------------------------------

_Middlemac_ overrides the behavior to some _Middleman_ partials in order to
provide extra functionality and/or to provide backward compatibility. They are
fully documented in [their reference section][helpers_ext_ref].

`partial`

  : Starting with _Middleman_ version 4, the use of `partials_dir` was removed,
    and now _Middleman_ expects a full path to partials. _Middlemac_, though
    provides this helper with backwards compatibility. If you set `partials_dir`
    in your `config.rb`, then _Middlemac_ will first check this directory for
    your partial before using _Middleman_’s default behavior.

`image_tag`

  : _Middlemac_ adds considerable functionality to the base `image_tag` helper.
  
      - If your image name begins with the magic prefix `all-`, then
        _Middlemac_ will substitute an image prefixed with the name of the
        current target, if it exists (otherwise the `all-` image will be used).
        This magic prefix is configurable in your `config.rb` file.
        
      - If the image that you specify has an `@2x`, `@3x`, and/or `@4x` version,
        then a `srcset` attribute specifying this Retina image will 
        automatically be added for you (unless you’ve added a `srcset` attribute
        yourself. This even works with magic prefixes.
        
        For example if you specify image `all-example.png` and your target is
        "pro", _and_ if the images exist, then _Middlemac_ will generate an
        image tag specifying "pro-example.png" and "pro-example@2x.png" for
        you.
        
      - You can specify `:target` and/or `:feature` in the `image_tag` options
        to ensure that a tag is only generated if you are building the correct
        target, or if the target includes the specified feature. This provides
        a handy alternative to **if target_name?** and **if target_feature?**
        blocks in your code.
      
      - The help automatically embeds images in a `<figure>` element, as this is
        what Apple’s own style is. You can specify `:figure => false` in the
        options to prevent this.
        
      - Finally, you can specify `:figure_class => "someclass"` to provide a 
        class to this framing `<figure>`, if desired.

### `image_tag` Target/Feature example

This example is a standard use of the `image_tag` helper with an ordinary file
wherein the `@2x` resource is included as a `srcset` automatically.

~~~ erb
<%%= image_tag 'middlemac-logo-small.png' %>
~~~

<%= image_tag 'middlemac-logo-small.png' %>

* * *

This example shows an icon with an image prefixed `all-`, however no target
specific images are in the image directory. There is an `@2x` version available,
though, so will be automatically used as the `srcset`.

~~~ erb
<%%= image_tag 'all-sample.png' %>
~~~

<%= image_tag 'all-sample.png' %>


* * *

The next example selects the image based on the target automatically.

~~~ erb
<%%= image_tag 'all-middlemac-logo-small.png' %>
~~~

<%= image_tag 'all-middlemac-logo-small.png' %>


* * *

Finally, let’s add a `:target` option to the `image_tag` helper. If you’re
using the Pro version of this documentation, you will see the logo, otherwise
there will be no image.

~~~ erb
<%%= image_tag 'all-sample.png', :target=>:pro %>
~~~

<%= image_tag 'all-sample.png', :target=>:pro %>

_Middlemac_ helpers
-------------------

_Middlemac_ introduces several other helpers that are available in your files.
A comprehensive list is available in the **Reference**, but these highlight
some of the helpers that you’ll use quite often.

| `cfBundleIdentifier`        | Returns the product `CFBundleIdentifier` for the current target.
| `cfBundleName`              | Returns the product `CFBundleName` for the current target.
| `product_name`              | Returns the `ProductName` for the current target.
| `product_uri`               | Returns the `ProductURI` for the current target.
| `target_name`               | Returns the current build target.
| `target_name?(proposal)`    | Is the current target `proposal`?
| `target_feature?(proposal)` | Does the target have the feature `feature`?

Other Helpers
-------------

_Middlemac_ is a system consisting of several gems, all of which contribute
helpers of their own. These are completely documented in the
**API Reference** section.
