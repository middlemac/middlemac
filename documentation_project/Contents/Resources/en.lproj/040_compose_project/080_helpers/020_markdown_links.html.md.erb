title:  ‹md_links› Helper
blurb:  Learn to take advantage of helpers that give you a hand using 
        reference style links to content and images.
---
<%= md_links %>
<%= md_images %>

<%= current_page.data.blurb %>

You’ll notice (as you look at the source files for this help content) that the
first ERB instructions immediately after the frontmatter are:

~~~ erb
<%%= md_links %>
<%%= md_images %>
~~~

These convenience helpers make it relatively simple to include Markdown links
and images using the reference format.
 
Links
-----

~~~ markdown
[What is Middlemac?][what_is_middlemac]
~~~

…will generate the following link:

[What is Middlemac?][what_is_middlemac]

This is especially useful if your page source filenames stay constant.

The reference name will always be the base output name of the file. For index
files, the format will be `groupname`, where the groupname is the name of the
containing directory, as you should already know. The top-level index file
will conveniently, simply be `en.lproj` (or as appropriate for your
development locale).

You should strive to use unique filenames if you use this feature, as this
will ensure that your references remain unique. In the event of reference name
collisions, the reference name will be prepended with its nesting groups as
many levels as necessary to become unique. For convenience items that are
higher in your directory hierarchy are prioritized against prepending.

Here’s the complete result of this helper for this Help Book:

<% code('markdown', :css_class => 'shrink_code') do %>
<%= md_links %>
<% end %>
