title:  ‹md_images› Helper
blurb:  Learn to take advantage of helpers that give you a hand using 
        reference style links to content and images.
---
<%= md_links %>
<%= md_images %>

<%= current_page.data.blurb %>

You’ll notice (as you look at the source files for this help content) that the
first ERB instructions immediately after the frontmatter are:

~~~ erb
<%%= md_links %>
<%%= md_images %>
~~~

These convenience helpers make it relatively simple to include Markdown links
and images using the reference format.
 
 
Images
------

Markdown also supports a reference format for images. It looks like this:

~~~ markdown
![this is alt tag content][middlemac-logo-small]
~~~

And will generate this:

![this is alt tag content][middlemac-logo-small]


Here’s the complete result of this helper for this Help Book:

<% code('markdown', :css_class => 'shrink_code') do %>
<%= md_images %>
<% end %>
Note that using reference style Markdown images is performed by the Markdown
processor directly. Using magic prefixes for automatic target-based images
won’t work. However they will work with standard Markdown, non-reference
images. Note how this next example includes the target-specific logo:
{: .note}

~~~ markdown
![target specific logo](all-middlemac-logo-small)
~~~

![target specific logo](all-middlemac-logo-small)
