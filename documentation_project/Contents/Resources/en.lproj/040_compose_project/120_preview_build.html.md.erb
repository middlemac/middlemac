title:  Preview and Build your Help Books
blurb:  >
        Your development be quicker by previewing your work with
        <em>Middleman</em>’s preview server before the next step:

Preview in a Web Browser
------------------------

_Middleman_ has its own web server so that you can preview your work during
development. From within your project directory, simply do:

~~~
bundle exec middleman
~~~

This will start the server with your default target. To specify a specific
target to serve, simply use the `--target` command line option:

~~~
bundle exec middleman --target your_target_here
~~~

In general the server address to connect to in your browser is
`localhost:4567`, but your environment could be different. The server will
always provide one or more addresses to try.

Note also that if you try to connect to your Help Book project at the server
root, you will receive a file not found error. Do remember that due to macOS
Help Book requirements, the content actually begins at
`/Resources/index.html`.


Build your Help Book(s)
-----------------------

Building your projects is similarly easy:

~~~
bundle exec middleman build
~~~

…to build the default target.

~~~
bundle exec middleman build --target your_target_here
~~~

…to build the target named `your_target_here`.


~~~
bundle exec middleman build_all
~~~

…to build all of your targets at once.


Opening your Help Books
-----------------------

macOS won't open Help Books that haven’t been indexed by the operating system,
so you’ll have to preview them in a real application. Because you’re making
a Help Book, it’s presumed that you have an application that can fill this
role. If not, you can modify the included **HelpViewerApp** Xcode project
that’s in this documentation project’s directory.

To view the contents of the `.help` package in **Finder**, simply
context-click it and choose **Show Package Contents**.


Troubleshooting Caches
----------------------

Sometimes your Help Books will not function properly in Apple Help Viewer.
This can occur during development particularly, because macOS performs caching
to improve performance. If you experience difficulties with your Help Book
in Apple Help Viewer, consider clearing the caches by deleting the directories
`~/Library/Caches/com.apple.helpd/` and
`~/Library/Caches/com.apple.helpviewer/`.
