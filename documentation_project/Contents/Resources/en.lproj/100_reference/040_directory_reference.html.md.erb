`your_project/`

: This is the self-contained directory containing everything that you need to
  configure and build your project.
  
`your_project/config.rb`

: This file contains most of your project settings for configuring
  _Middlemac_, _Middleman_, and other _Middleman_ extensions you might add
  in the future. 

`your_project/Gemfile`

: This file keeps track of the Ruby dependencies that are required for
  _Middleman_ to work. You can edit this file to add additional _Middleman_
  extensions, should you wish _Middlemac_/_Middleman_ do something more.

`your_project/Gemfile.lock`

: This is the bundler-generated file specifying the _exact_ dependency
  configuration used. As Ruby Gems are updated on your system, this file will
  ensure that updated versions are _not_ used, so that your configuration
  stays frozen and steady. You can `bundle update` when you are ready to use
  the newest version of Gems; doing so regenerates this file.

`your_project/middlemac.webloc`

: This is a convenient shortcut that, when used, will open your Help Book
  in the default browser to the main `index.html` file.

`your_project/Contents/`

: Contains everything in your help project that will be compiled into or
  contribute to the final `.help` project.
   

`your_project/Contents/Info.plist.erb`

: The `Info.plist.erb` file is the file that _Middlemac_ will process into the
  final `Info.plist` that your macOS application needs in order to work with
  your Help Book. For a basic project you shouldn’t have to modify anything in
  this file, but if you want or need to have other key-value pairs in the
  final `Info.plist`, then add them here. 
   

`your_project/Contents/Resources/index.html`

: This file is the heart of your entire modern Help Book. When the Help Book
  is open in Apple Help Viewer or being served to your web browser, it is the
  only page that you will ever truly see. The entire rest of your Help Book,
  in any language, is loaded by this file for display via AJAX. Consequently,
  it strips out most of the `<head>` information from your own files, loads
  all of the JavaScripts and styles, and manages language selection, TOC, and
  everything else in your Help Book.
  
  The data that appear in your generated HTML documents’ `<head>` is still
  critical to the Apple Help Indexer. Don’t try to simplify things by removing
  these items from the layout templates.
  
  You generally should never have to edit this file, unless you want to
  include some CSS or JavaScript that is not provided by _Middlemac_.


`your_project/Contents/Resources/locale-list.json.erb`

: When served to a web browser, Apple’s JavaScript will refer to this file
  to determine which languages are available. This file is managed
  automatically by _Middlemac_ based on the actual `language.lproj` files
  that are present in your project.
   
   
`your_project/Contents/Resources/SharedGlobalAssets/`

: This directory contains assets that are common between all of your 
  different help language projects, as well as assets that _Middlemac_
  requires by convention, such as Apple’s CSS and JavaScripts, certain image
  files, data files, layouts, and so on.
   
   
`your_project/Contents/Resources/SharedGlobalAssets/_data/`

: This directory contains data files that you can use to supply data for
  [using local data][local_data]. This directory will not be
  output in the final build.
    

`your_project/Contents/Resources/SharedGlobalAssets/_data/locale-list.json`

: This file contains all of the source information for the locales that
  _Middlemac_ supports “out of the box,” and is the same that Apple
  generally provides for most of its applications. You should consult this
  file to determine the correct `language.lproj` directory name to use for
  developing help for locales other then the default `en.lproj`.


`your_project/Contents/Resources/SharedGlobalAssets/_layouts/`

: All layouts and templates should go here. This directory will not be
  output in the final build.


`your_project/Contents/Resources/SharedGlobalAssets/_layouts/layout-apple-modern-aside.haml`

: This is the layout use for “aside” files. Your asides should set their
  `layout` frontmatter key to this layout.


`your_project/Contents/Resources/SharedGlobalAssets/_layouts/layout-apple-modern.haml`

: This is the layout for all content files, and is used by default when
  the frontmatter does not override it with a different `layout` key.


`your_project/Contents/Resources/SharedGlobalAssets/_layouts/layout-blank.haml`

: This is a layout that generates no content, and should be used for group
  metadata `index.html` files.


`your_project/Contents/Resources/SharedGlobalAssets/_partials/`

: Partials can go here, and should be prefaced with an underscore so that
  they will not generate build output. Partial files can also be included
  in any other directory, too. This is for organizational convenience of
  common partials that may be used anywhere.


`your_project/Contents/Resources/SharedGlobalAssets/convention/`

: Images that the Apple Help Book and _Middlemac_ require by convention go
  here. This is separate from the `images/` directory simply to make
  directory management simpler by avoiding the mixing of required and
  non-required files.
  
  
`your_project/Contents/Resources/SharedGlobalAssets/css/`

: Your `.css` and `.scss` files should go here.
  

`your_project/Contents/Resources/SharedGlobalAssets/css/apple/`

: Apple’s CSS and CSS related files exist in this directory.
  

`your_project/Contents/Resources/SharedGlobalAssets/css/middlemac/`

: _Middlemac_’s CSS and CSS related files exist in this directory.
  

`your_project/Contents/Resources/SharedGlobalAssets/fonts/`

: Any fonts that you wish to include should go here. In general if you are
  building an Apple Help Book, additional fonts should not be needed.
  

`your_project/Contents/Resources/SharedGlobalAssets/images/`

: All images should go here. _Middleman_ will find them automatically if
  you use the helpers.


`your_project/Contents/Resources/SharedGlobalAssets/js/`

: Javascripts, if any, should go here. They will not be included
  automatically in your project unless you modify the main `index.html`
  file to include them.


`your_project/Contents/Resources/SharedGlobalAssets/js/app.5.1.xx.js`
`your_project/Contents/Resources/SharedGlobalAssets/js/middlemac-debug.js`
`your_project/Contents/Resources/SharedGlobalAssets/js/vendor.js`

: These are the Apple and _Middlemac_ JavaScript files that operate the
  modern Apple Help Book. Note that the `app.5.1.xx.js` file is as Apple
  originally provides it, with some minor editing to work with `<img>` tag
  `srcset` attributes.
  
  You should add any JavaScripts that your HelpBook requires here, and then
  modify the main `index.html` file to include them.

   
`your_project/Contents/Resources/en.lproj`

: This directory serves as your base [group][groups] for the English version
  of your Help Book, and it contains all of your Help Book’s content,
  including locale-specific versions of your resources.
   
  Any other files that result in `.html` in this directory level, except for
  `index.html` constitute part of the `en.lproj` group. At this level you
  should start adding directories to contain your other groups.
   
  Certainly, you’re not required to develop in English, and _Middlemac_
  supports multiple languages simultaneously. Out of the box, you can use
  any language supported by `SharedGlobalAssets/_data/locale-list.json`.

`your_project/Contents/Resources/en.lproj/ExactMatch.plist.erb`

: This file supplements the `.helpindex` file when the Help Book is viewed in
  Apple Help Viewer by providing exact word matching. _Middlemac_ generates
  the finished version of this file based on the `exactmatch` keys in your
  pages’ frontmatter. See [Apple’s documentation][1] for details.

   
`your_project/Contents/Resources/en.lproj/InfoPlist.strings`

: The `InfoPlist.strings` file is the file that _Middlemac_ will process into
 the final `InfoPlist.strings`, which contains the localized version of your
 applications’ human-readable `Info.plist` data (specifically, `CFBundleName`
 and `HPDBookTitle`).


`your_project/Contents/Resources/en.lproj/locale-info.json.erb`

: This file contains metadata used by Apple’s JavaScript to understand the
  locale details for this locale’s directory. It is managed automatically by
  _Middlemac_.  


`your_project/Contents/Resources/en.lproj/navigation.json.erb`

: _Middlemac_ builds the output version of this file from your Help Book’s
  sitemap. It is used by Apple’s JavaScript to make all of the navigation
  features possible.


`your_project/Contents/Resources/en.lproj/searchTree.json..erb`

: This file contains the search index used when your Help Book is viewed in
  a browser. _Middlemac_ generates the final version of this file when it
  indexes your Help Book.


`your_project/Contents/Resources/en.lproj/asides/`

: This optional folder can be used to hold your aside files. Besides being a
  convenient organizational location, it has the magic property of not
  requiring the `aside` category in their frontmatter.

`your_project/Contents/Resources/en.lproj/assets/`

: This directory contains all of the localized assets used in your Help Book.
 In order for _Middlemac_’s asset helpers such as `image_tag` and `partial`
 to find localized resources, any subdirectories of `assets/` must mirror
 the subdirectories of `SharedGlobalAssets/`, e.g., `assets/images/`.
