`middleman` command signature
-----------------------------

You will use `middleman` to build `middlemac` projects.

~~~
bundle exec middleman [[build|server] [--target xxx]] | [build_all|all]
~~~

You can determine what the valid targets are by simply omitting a target after
the `--target` option. This will cause an invalid target error and present you
with a list of targets defined in the project.


`middlemac` command signature
-----------------------------

_Middlemac_ offers its own commands for generating new projects and getting
help.

~~~
middlemac [init|documentation|help|--version]
~~~

Use `init` to generate the structure for a new, empty project, and use
`documentation` to generate a project that can build this very documentation.


`middlemac-targets` command signature
-------------------------------------

~~~
middlemac-targets [documentation|help|--version]
~~~

Use `documentation` to generate a project that can build complete documentation.
