Frontmatter
-----------
Frontmatter is metadata that is included at the top of every content page but
will not be present in the output. It is used to provide information to
_Middleman_ and _Middlemac_ on a page by page and group basis.

Here is the frontmatter from this very page’s source file:

You can also specify your own frontmatter keys and values. All frontmatter is
available for use in your pages and templates via `current_page.data`, e.g.,
`current_page.data.title`.


Middlemac Frontmatter Keys
--------------------------

`anchor`

 : Every Help Book page that you generate will include an anchor, which is
   usually the page name determined by _Middlemac_, and can be found using
   the `current_page.page_name` helper. You can specify your own anchor, if
   you prefer, using this frontmatter key.
   
   Anchors are very useful when using `NSHelpManager` to open a Help Book to a
   specific page.
   
`blurb`

 : The blurb will be used as a `meta description` for each of your pages, where
   it will be picked up and indexed by the Apple Help Indexer. This Help Book
   also uses the blurb on most pages as the opening paragraph. Finally, the
   blurb is used in building the `navigation.json` file.

`categories`

 : Pages can be assigned to one or more categories which _Middlemac_ and
   Apple’s help system will use to control certain behaviors. Your landing
   page should be assigned the category `landing`. If you have a copyright
   page, it should be assigned `copyright`. Any “aside” pages should be
   assigned `aside` among their categories.

`exactmatch`

 : You can add `ExactMatch.plist` entries, which will be added to the final
   `ExactMatch.plist` when the Help Book is built.
 
`exclude`

 : Indicates which [targets and features][targets_and_features] this page should
   be hidden from.
   
`keywords`

 : Specify keywords for the `meta keywords` tag for each page of your Help
   Book. These will be indexed by web crawlers (if your project is online),
   and importantly, will be indexed by the Apple Help Indexer so that search
   may work.

`layout`

 : Specify the layout or template to use to render the page. If you don’t
   specify a layout, then the `layout-apple-modern` layout will be used by
   default.
   
   In general, the default works perfectly fine for building a modern Apple
   Help Book. However, [group][groups] `index.html` metadata files should be
   set to `layout-blank`, and “aside” pages should be set to 
   `layout-apple-modern-aside`.

`order`

 : Set the sorting/display order for a particular file within its group.

`target`

 : Indicates which [targets and features][targets_and_features] this page is
   applicable for.

`title`

 : The page title will be used in to the HTML `<title>` tag for every page,
   and more importantly, will be the text displayed for links by all of
   _Middlemac_’s helpers and Apple’s Help Book navigation.
