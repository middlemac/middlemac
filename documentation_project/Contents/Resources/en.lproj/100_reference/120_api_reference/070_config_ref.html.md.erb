## Targets Configuration

The targets configuration appears immediately after the
`activate :MiddlemanTargets` line.

Note that `:build_dir` is included for the sake of completeness in the list
below, but it’s not currently used in a _Middleman_ project’s `config.rb` file.

<%= partial 'yard_mmtargets_config' %>

Additional information about the contents of the `targets` hash is available 
in the [Set up your Help Project][setup] article.

## Middlemac Configuration

The `activate :Middlemac do |options|` block adds some finishing touches.
