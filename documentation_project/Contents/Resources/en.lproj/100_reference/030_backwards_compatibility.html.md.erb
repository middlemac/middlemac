_Middlemac_ version 3.0.0 is a **major** update. It’s an API-breaking update
and projects using _Middlemac_ version 1._x_ or version 2._x_ will _not_ build
without some changes to your project.

This version of _Middlemac_ is a complete rewrite, and this was done in an
effort to let Apple’s Help Book tools do their job and make modern Apple Help
books. If you prefer full, manual control and custom styles that deviate from
Apple’s look and feel, it’s suggested that you stick with _Middlemac_ version
2.0.

Middlemac 3.0 compared to older versions
----------------------------------------

_Middlemac_ versions prior to 3.0 were intended to provided tools giving you
maximum control over page appearance while providing tools to allow automatic
navigation within groups/sections. Although it shipped with layout templates
and CSS to emulate the look of Apple’s Help Books for versions prior to
macOS 10.10 (i.e., “Mavericks” and earlier), you were always encouraged to
customize.

_Middlemac_ 3.0, however, does away with _all of that_ in favor of building
Apple Help Books that follow Apple’s own examples, standards, and practices.
_Middlemac_ no longer builds Help Books that emulate a style, rather, Apple’s
own tools provide the style and functionality. This necessarily represents a
departure from the previous model of doing things.


Project Upgrade Tips
--------------------

No automated method of upgrading a project is provided, but the steps for
achieving an upgrade are fairly simple.

The _vast_ majority of your source files will continue to work as they did in
the past, although you may wish to reorganize them to align nicely with the way
that modern Apple Help Books work. Here are some tips to help you migrate
faster:

- Begin by _reading_ this documentation and having a close look at the sample
  project.

- Take a look at the [Directory and File Reference][directory_reference],
  to have a good understanding of what all of the new files do, and what their
  functions are.

- **It’s probably easiest to move your old source HTML files into the new sample
  project.**

- Some Markdown reference style links may have their references changed. Keep a
  lookout for this.

- There’s a new option called `show_debug` in the new `config.rb` file. Set this
  to `true` to see all of the `md_links` and `md_images` values at the bottom
  of each Help Book page. This setting will also highlight non-working Markdown
  reference style links.

- `Base.lproj` is not supported by modern Apple Help Books. Ensure that this
  directory is named `en.lproj`, or some other locale name supported by Apple’s
  Help Book system.
  
- Group landing pages are no longer supported, because modern Apple Help Books
  do no use them. Instead, group landing pages are now used solely as metadata
  containers to provide the name of the group. If you absolutely require a
  landing page, you can create a topic page in the group.
  
- In Apple parlance, “groups” are now called “sections,” although in order to
  preserve as much backwards compatibility as possible, functions relating to
  groups, if you use them, refer to groups.

- Most of the group navigation features and all of the helpers are no longer
  included, nor are breadcrumbs. Modern Apple Help Books do not use them, and
  handle all navigation via their JavaScript, so this support was dropped. If
  you wish to go against Apple’s style, you can re-introduce these partials from
  an older version of _Middleman_ yourself, as all of the internal logic is
  still present.
