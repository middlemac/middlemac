Apple’s modern Help Books use a feature call an “aside” to show short bits of
information that can be referenced in the current page without having to load
a new page.

The [frontmatter][frontmatter] for this page should indicate
`layout-apple-modern-aside`, but because the source file is in the `asides/`
directory, _Middlemac_ is smart enough to supply that automatically. This is
necessary because the layout for asides contains extra metadata needed for
this feature to work.

Because these asides are separate HTML files, they can be re-used in multiple
locations throughout your project, much like partials.
