multiple versions of your application or a single version, once properly 
configured, _Middlemac_ will take all of the pain out of building Help files.

You are viewing the `:pro` target. You will see a lot of branding indicating
_Middlemac Pro_, but remember thereâ€™s only a single version of _Middlemac_.
The different branding is one of the core benefits of using _Middlemac_.
