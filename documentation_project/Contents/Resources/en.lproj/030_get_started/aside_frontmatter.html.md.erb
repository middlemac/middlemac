Front matter is a document header section in format called YAML that contains
key-value data that applies to a page. This data can be referred to later for
output or control. For example, the title of this page was specified with a
`title:` key in the source document’s front matter, and it was given a blurb
(used as the opening paragraph and also the `meta description` `content` value
for the page) via the `blurb:` key.

If you examine the source for this page, you might notice that there is no
`meta description` tag in the `head`; rest assured, it _is_ present in the
HTML file, and used by the Apple Help Indexer.

Front matter can also control page order within a section, inclusion of pages
for targets/features (provided by the `middleman-targets` gem), and more.

Here’s this document’s front matter:

~~~ yaml

title:  Front Matter
blurb:  _Middleman_ (and hence _Middlemac_) source files use front matter to
        control many features of pages.

## Declaring Front Matter

Front matter is defined as being delimited at the beginning and end with a line
consisting of a series of three hyphens (`-`), and this block must appear at the
top of a document.

Although specific front matter keys are discussed elsewhere in this
documentation it’s worth pointing out that the `title:` and `:blurb` are used
extensively in _Middlemac_. For example all of the automatic navigation
features are built using this data, meaning that this data need only appear
once, here, in this very document.


## JSON Frontmatter

Recent versions of _Middleman_ support the use of JSON instead of YAML for
frontmatter. The following example show how this page’s frontmatter may have
been written instead:

~~~ json
;;;
"title":  "Front Matter",
"blurb":  "_Middleman_ (and hence _Middlemac_) source files use front matter to control many features of pages."
;;;
~~~

JSON is indicated with delimiting `;;;` instead of hyphens.
