_Middleman_ is a [static site generator using all the shortcuts and tools in
modern web development](http://middlemanapp.com). It was intended to have been
a tool to create static websites with most of the dynamism of websites running
on technologies such as PHP and Ruby on Rails. Static websites are fast and
secure.

Apple Help Books, in their essence, are static websites. 

_Middleman_ with the help of _Middlemac_ is the perfect tool in your help file
development toolchain.

Builder _and_ server
--------------------
_Middleman_ doesn’t merely build final output; it includes a non-configuration
server that makes it much easier to develop your website or Help Book. Features
such as live reload mean that when you change your source file, the site in
your web browser will update automatically.

The server captures changes to most of your source files. However in certain
circumstances you may have to restart the server to recognize certain changes,
such as new directories in your source code.


Basic concepts
--------------
_Middleman_’s basic concepts are these:

- Organize your site in a source directory that mirrors the desired structure
  on the server (or in our case, in our Help Book).
- Add file extensions to the source files to indicate the type of pre-processing
  that you want to perform on each of them.
- Provide the ability to include partials and use helpers to improve your
  content development productivity, while keeping yourself DRY.
- Provide the ability to use templates and layouts to bring uniformity to your
  website (in our case, to your Help Book).
- Act as a server in developer mode, building content dynamically as you develop
  it.
- Build final output, ready to use wherever you need it.


Using _Middleman_
-----------------

Because _Middlemac_ is an extension to _Middleman_, it’s worth noting that you
will actually execute `middleman` to serve or to build your projects. 

To start the built-in server in order to preview your work, simply do:

~~~
bundle exec middleman serve --target free
~~~

Instructions for accessing the server (the address and port) will be reported to
you.

Note, too, that `--target` specifies an option; the example above would serve
the `free` target.

To build the `pro` target, you would do this:

~~~
bundle exec middleman build --target pro
~~~

And if you wanted to build every target at once, simply this:

~~~
bundle exec middleman build_all
~~~


More about _Middleman_
----------------------

If you stick to the conventions it’s not necessary to become an expert in
_Middleman_. However as you grow your skills you may want to consider using
some of its more advanced features or even add your own extensions. You can
access _Middleman_’s full documentation on its
[documentation website](https://middlemanapp.com/basics/install/).
