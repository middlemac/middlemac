<%= current_page.data.title %>
==============================

<%= current_page.data.blurb %>

You can use data from external sources with _Middleman_ and _Middlemac_, too.
In `assets/data/` a sample `globals.yml` contains some sample data in YAML
format. Letâ€™s see what it contains:

<% data.globals.famous_writers.each do |writer| %>
- A sample work of <%= writer.author %> is _<%= writer.sample_work %>_.
<% end %>

These previous sentences were generated with this ERB code:

~~~ erb
<%% data.globals.famous_writers.each do |writer| %>
- A sample work of <%%= writer.author %> is _<%%= writer.sample_work %>_.
<%% end %>
~~~


Accessing data
--------------

This data is available to you via `data.file_name.top_level_key`.
