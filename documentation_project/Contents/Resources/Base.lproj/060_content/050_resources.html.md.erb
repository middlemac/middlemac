_Resources_ in _Middleman_-speak generally refers to pages in _Middleman_’s
internal site-map. As Ruby objects, resources have a lot of useful information
about them.

Note: there’s a lot you can do with _Middlemac_ without manipulating or using
resources directly. The _Middlemac_ framework does a lot of this manipulation
for you. There’s nothing in this documentation help book, for example, that uses
features not provided by the conventions.

Common _Middleman_ Resources
----------------------------

Because _Middlemac_’s resources depend so heavily on the built-in resources, a
quick review and examples are in order.

`current_page` or `current_resource`
 : The `current_page` resource is available in all of your help pages, as well
   as the partials that your help pages include.

`current_page.breadcrumbs.first`
 : This refers to the top level landing page of your help file.
 
_`resource`_`.parent`
 : This references the parent resource. For example `current_page.parent` would
   refer to the parent page of this one:
   **<%= current_page.parent.data.title %>**.
 
_`resource`_`.brethren_next` and _`resource`_`.brethren_previous`
 : These _Middlemac_ supplied references refer to the next and previous pages,
   respectively, in the current group, and they are resources, too.


API Reference

Have a closer look at all of the _Middlemac_-provided resource extensions in
the [Resource API Documentation][resource_ext_ref].
