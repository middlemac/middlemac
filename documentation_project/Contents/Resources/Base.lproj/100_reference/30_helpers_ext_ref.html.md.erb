==============================

<%= current_page.data.blurb %>

Although _Middlemac_ has plenty of its own helpers, it also offers extensions
to several of the built-in helpers. These appear in their own section here.
They are organized by the Ruby gem that introduces their functionality.

* * *

## `middleman-targets` extended helpers

<%= partial 'yard_targets_helpers_extended' %>


* * *

## `middleman-pagegroups` extended helpers

<%= partial 'yard_pagegroups_helpers_extended' %>


* * *

## `middlemac-extras` extended helpers

<%= partial 'yard_extras_helpers_extended' %>


* * *

## `middlemac` extended helpers

<%= partial 'yard_middlemac_helpers_extended' %>

* * *

Note that partials listed with multiple Gems have cumulative effects. For
example the `image_tag` partial, when used with _Middlemac_ projects, can use
all of the parameters added by any Ruby gem.
