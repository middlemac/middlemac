<%= current_page.data.title %>
==============================

<%= current_page.data.blurb %>

Breadcrumbs by default appear on every page of your help file, except for the
main landing page (which, as root, has no breadcrumb trail).

There are two helpers that can each produce the breadcrumbs widget that’s at
the top:
 
`nav_breadcrumbs`
 : Produces breadcrumbs ending with the title of the current page. 
 
`nav_breadcrumbs_alt`
 : Produces breadcrumbs with “Current page” at the end instead of the title of
   the current page.


Configuration
-------------
Breadcrumbs are configured in your `config.rb` file using the `Breadcrumbs`
option, which can be set to one of the two helpers above, or to `nil` to
disable breadcrumbs completely.

If you design your own breadcrumbs helper, you can use the same configuration
setting to use it instead, too: simply specify the name of your own breadcrumbs
helper.


Including Breadcrumbs
---------------------
_Middlemac_ includes breadcrumbs in the `layout-html4` template.
