The included CSS and fonts are critical for ensuring that the templates work,
but they also serve to provide a recent Apple-like look and feel to your help
books.

## The `assets/fonts/` directory

`font-awesome/*` (directory)
 : The files here provide you the ability to use the icons in the font provided
   by the [font-awesome](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) project.
   You can review their documentation if you’d like to include these easy to
   use images in your project. This documentation uses icons in the navigator
   buttons.
   
## The `assets/stylesheets/` directory

`_apple_helpbook.scss`
 : This file contains all of the real styling for _Middlemac_ help books. This
   should be the first place you check for making desired changes.
   
   Note that this `.scss` file will be processed but not output to the build
   directory because it starts with an underscore.
 
`_github.scss`
 : This file contains the styling used for Markdown `<code>` blocks for syntax
   highlighting, and provides highlighting similar to Github’s style.
 
   Note that this `.scss` file will not output to the build directory because it
   starts with an underscore.

`_normalize.scss`
 : Although _Middlemac_ is intended to build Apple Help Books, its content can
   be viewed in web browsers, too. Therefore for convenience, this standard
   normalize file will help ensure that your content looks nearly the same in
   any modern, popular browser.
 
   Note that this `.scss` file will be processed but not output to the build
   directory because it starts with an underscore.

`breadcrumb-separator-light.png`
 : This image is used by CSS to provide a separator between breadcrumb items.
   It’s not out of place being in a stylesheets directory.

`images_sizes.css.erb`
 : This `.erb` file is processed into a stylesheet (via the `css_image_sizes`
   helper) containing the maximum width and height of every image asset in your
   project. This will ensure that strange scaling doesn’t occur, and can save
   time by not having to specify fixed image widths and heights for images you
   may want to use.
   
   This file will be copied to the build project and must be included in your
   layouts if you wish to use it.

`style.css.scss`
 : _This_ file, when compiled to CSS, `@include`’s the pertinent files above 
   and bundles them into a single file that is included in the default layouts.
