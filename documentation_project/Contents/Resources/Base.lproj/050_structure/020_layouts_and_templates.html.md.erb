_Middlemac_ decouples your help _content_ from the display and final document
structure by taking advantage of layouts and templates. In general both layouts
and templates do the same thing; they wrap your content into the structure
required of an HTML file.

In practice, though, _Middlemac_ distinguishes between them in the manner: a
_layout_ defines the formal HTML structure of the end document, and a template
defines the superficial appearance of a particular page. For example a page
might be wrapped in the `template-logo-medium` template to define its overall
look, and then further wrapped in `layout-html4` to ensure that it has the
required structure for an Apple help book.


Templates
---------

_Middlemac_ comes with three templates inspired by recent Mac OS X help files.
Although you can certainly use any of the templates you desire (or create your
own), the included templates were designed with specific purposes in mind.

`template-logo-large`
 : This template features your help icon in a large size with your target’s
   `ProductName` and `ProductURI` below it, in a left frame-like area. Your
   content is in the right frame-like area. This template was designed to be
   suited for the main landing page and for main section landing pages
   consisting primarily of links and descriptions of other pages.

`template-logo-medium`
 : This template places a smaller logo in a frame-like area to the right,
   followed by automatically placed “related links” to other pages in the same
   group. Your content will occupy the large, left side of the window. This
   template is idea for multiple, related pages within a group.

`template-logo-small`
 : The template places a very small logo at the top of your page. Related links
   will appear at the bottom of the page after your content. This template is
   most suited for topics that stand somewhat alone.

Each of these templates will wrap a layout around them. By default they will
always use `layout-html4`, although you can force _Middlemac_ to use the
`layout-xhtml` template with the `:xhtml` frontmatter key. You should never do
this, though, as Apple requires your content -- except the top level landing
page -- to be HTML4.


Layouts
-------

`layout-html4`
  : This is just an HTML 4.01 wrapper template and if you follow all of the
    conventions there's nothing you should have to change here.

`layout-xhtml`
  : Apple's help landing page (the main page) is supposed to be an XHTML 1.0
    Strict document. If you follow all of the conventions there's nothing you
    should have to change here.
