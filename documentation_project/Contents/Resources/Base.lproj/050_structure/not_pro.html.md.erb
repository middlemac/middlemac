How is this accomplished?
-------------------------

This is the frontmatter for this page. Note the key `exclude`, which indicates
that this is page should be hidden from _Middleman_’s navigation system and
build output.

The opposite of `exclude` is `target`. If you use `target`, only those targets
included in the target list will be included in _Middlemac_ navigation.
Using `exclude` overrides `target`.

Note that `target` and `exclude` are lists; you can specify multiple targets and
[features][features_overview] (which also can be used).
