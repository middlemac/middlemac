==============================

<%= current_page.data.blurb %>

Near the bottom of this page you can see the navigator. It’s visible because
this page’s parent `index.html` file includes `navigate: true` in its
frontmatter.

Setting `:navigate` in the frontmatter will cause all pages with an
[order][groups] to display the navigator. This can be overridden on a
page-per-page basis by using the `:navigator` frontmatter key, e.g., `navigator:
false`.

The helper `nav_prev_next` provides the navigator structure, and the appearance
is set in CSS.
