==============================

Getting Started
---------------

_Middlemac_’s documentation is included in the starter project (and more than
likely at [http://www.balthisar.com/manuals](http://www.balthisar.com/manuals)).
There are multiple ways you could be reading this content now, but for now we
will assume that you have not yet installed _Middlemac_ and its dependencies.

To get started and read the full documentation, make sure that your system has
[Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/) installed (it comes pre-installed on Mac OS X
and some Linuxes), and follow these steps below. 

We now recommend the use of the Ruby Version Manager [(RVM)](https://rvm.io/).
While installation and setup of RVM is entirely outside the scope of this
tutorial, it avoids the use of `sudo` and the occasional hassles involved with
using the built in version of Ruby.
{:.note}

Note that depending on your system’s setup you might have to prefix some of the
commands below with `sudo`. For example if the instruction is given as
`gem install bundler` and a permissions error is reported, you may probably
have to use `sudo gem install bundler` instead.
{:.note}

If you’re behind a proxy and haven’t already setup an `http-proxy` environment
variable, then that previous clause is a good hint and Google is your friend.

Quick version, if you don’t want to read details
------------------------------------------------

In your Terminal, do each of the following:

~~~ bash
xcode-select --install
gem install middlemac
middlemac documentation
cd middlemac-docs
gem install bundler
bundle install
bundle exec middleman --target free
open middlemac.webloc
~~~

Because the penultimate command started the server which keeps control of the
terminal, you’ll have to open the `.webloc` file in another terminal session,
or simply double-click it.

If you’re on Linux and `open middlemac.webloc` command doesn’t work for you,
then use your preferred web browser and go to
[http://localhost:4567/Resources/Base.lproj/](http://localhost:4567/Resources/Base.lproj/).

If you’ve setup your own custom domain, you’ll have to specify that instead of
`localhost`.


Similar to above, with a bit of handholding
----------------------------------------

### Install Xcode

If you’re on a Mac you’ll have to install Xcode first, or at least the Xcode
command line tools. You can _try_ just installing the tools first:

~~~ bash
xcode-select --install
~~~

If that fails or the rest of the installation fails, then install all of Xcode.
It’s available in the App Store. It’s free of charge. And you’re using this
project to develop help for Mac OS X applications that you’re developing using
Xcode anyway. Install it, already!

Dependencies on Linux are left up to you. Most modern Linuxes will prompt you to
install packages that are missing.
 
_Middlemac_ works quite well on Linux, but keep in mind that Linux doesn’t have
the help indexing tool that’s required in order to build a proper help book.
Other than for generating your final help book, Linux makes a fine development
environment.

### Install the `middlemac` gem

~~~ bash
gem install middlemac
~~~

This will fetch the gem from `rubygems.org` and install it for you.


### Install the documentation

~~~ bash
middlemac documentation
~~~

This will install Middlemac’s documentation project into a new directory
`middlemac-docs`.


### Go into the documentation directory

~~~ bash
cd middlemac-docs
~~~


### Install bundler (if not already installed)

~~~ bash
gem install bundler
~~~

Bundler is the most common Ruby package management system, and it will be used
to ensure that all of Middlemac’s dependencies are present.


### Make sure all of the project dependencies are met

~~~ bash
bundle install
~~~

This tells bundler to install the remaining gems that _Middlemac_ requires to
function.


### Start the _Middleman_ server

_Middleman_ comes with its own HTTP server and requires no configuration. It
simply works, serving your help book as a website.

~~~ bash
bundle exec middleman --target free
~~~

This will start the server using our `:free` target.


### Open the site in your browser

Simply open the `middlemac.webloc` file from Finder to view the project results
in your default browser.

Or can open the bookmark file from Terminal with `open middleman.webloc`.

Or you prefer to open the help site manually, or if the .webloc file doesn’t
work on your Linux distro, you can go to
[http://localhost:4567/Resources/Base.lproj/](http://localhost:4567/Resources/Base.lproj/).

If you’ve setup your own custom domain, you’ll have to specify that instead of
`localhost`.
