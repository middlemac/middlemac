_Middlemac_ takes care of a lot of the details for generating Apple Help Books,
and that may be reason enough to use _Middlemac_. However if you decide _not_ to
use Markdown, then you’re throwing away the single, largest contributor to your
help file building productivity that there is.


What is Markdown?
-----------------

In the words of the estimable John Gruber (the author of the original Markdown):

> Markdown is a text-to-HTML conversion tool for web writers. Markdown allows
> you to write using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format, then 
> convert it to structurally valid XHTML (or HTML).

This offers the powerful advantage of having text-based source files that are
themselves very highly legible. For example, this opening of this section of 
the page was written so:

~~~ markdown

As you can see, it’s highly legible and uses a lot of the same text formatting
idioms with which you are doubtlessly already aware.


Markdown Syntax and Engine
--------------------------

There are several “flavors” of Markdown, but they all adhere to John Gruber’s
original as a base line and extend it in various ways. For the most part, they
are all fairly well compatible.

_Middlemac_ uses [_Kramdown_](http://kramdown.gettalong.org/) as its Markdown
engine because that’s what _Middleman_ uses by default. You can read about all
its features an syntax on its 
[documentation page](http://kramdown.gettalong.org/documentation.html).
