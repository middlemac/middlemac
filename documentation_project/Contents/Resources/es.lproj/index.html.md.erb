This is the Spanish version of the landing page, and is included in this
documentation to demonstrate just a couple of features of Apple’s modern
Help Books:

- It demonstrates that _Middlemac_ plays nicely with multi-lingual help files.

- It demonstrates that when your Help Book is served to a browser, the help
  system will provide a language picker, allowing you to choose to view the
  help content in another language.
  
  In Apple’s Help Viewer, languages are managed automatically by the Help
  Viewer application from your macOS locale.

- It demonstrates Apple’s single-topic help style, e.g., such as those used
  for Help Books for simple applications that require only one page of
  content.
  
If you arrived here inadvertently (perhaps your locale is Spanish), the rest
of this documentation is available in the English version of the Help Book.
Please select the language chooser, below, to switch to English.
