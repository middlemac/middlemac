===================

_Middlemac_ is the specialized Apple HelpBook building system that uses the
tools of [_Middleman_](http://middlemanapp.com) to make building Apple HelpBooks
for your Mac OS X applications a snap. Whether you are targeting multiple
versions of your application or a single version, once properly (simply!)
configured, _Middlemac_ will take all of the pain out of building Help files.

_Middlemac_ makes it simple to do this in Terminal…

`./middlemac target1 target2 target3`

…and end up with versions of your HelpBooks with all of the Apple-required files
in the Apple-required formats in the correct locations of your XCode build
directory. Simply build your help target, run your application, and find that
it just works!

At its simplest _Middlemac_ offers:

- Write your help files with plain text using the **Markdown** format (if you
  are reading this file in a text editor, this is an example of Markdown).
- Single or multiple build **targets**, e.g., your `pro` target can include
  content specific to the professional version of your application.
- **Features** support for each build target, e.g. each of your build targets
  can specify whether or not they support specific features, and this content
  will be included or excluded as your needs require.
- A low learning curve if you’re a developer.
- A set of conventions and tools that make automatic tables of contents,
  automatic sections, and automatic behavior effortless to implement.
- A basic, Apple-like CSS stylesheet and set of templates that can be used as-is
  or easily tweaked to suit your needs.
