==============================

Getting Started
---------------

_Middlemac_’s documentation is included in the starter project (and more than
likely at [http://www.balthisar.com/manuals](http://www.balthisar.com/manuals)).
There are multiple ways you could be reading this content now, but for now we
will assume that you have not yet installed _Middlemac_ and its dependencies.

To get started and read the full documentation, make sure that your system has
[Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/) installed (it comes pre-installed on Mac OS X
and some Linuxes), and follow these steps below. 

Note that this is untested on Windows.

Note that depending on your system’s setup you might have to prefix some of the
commands below with `sudo`. For example if the instruction is given as
`gem install bundler` and a permissions error is reported, you may probably
have to use `sudo gem install bundler` instead.

If you’re behind a proxy and haven’t already setup an `http-proxy` environment
variable, then that previous clause is a good hint and Google is your friend.

### Install XCode

If you’re on a Mac you’ll have to install XCode first. It’s available in the App
Store free of charge. XCode provides dependencies that Ruby and several of its
gems require. It will also ensure that Apple’s help indexer is installed, which
is required if you want to produce proper help files on Mac OS X.

Dependencies on Linux are left up to you. Most modern Linuxes will prompt you to
install packages that are missing.
 
_Middlemac_ works quite well on Linux, but keep in mind that Linux doesn’t have
the help indexing tool that’s required in order to build a proper helpbook.
Other than for generating your final helpbook, Linux makes a fine development
environment.

### Install bundler

[Bundler](http://bundler.io/) is the ubiquitous Ruby
[gem](http://guides.rubygems.org/what-is-a-gem/) management tool. You can
install if from your terminal easily:

`gem install bundler`

Ruby will download and install Bundler.


### Install the _middlemac_ project template

Although _Middlemac_ is a [_Middleman_](http://middlemanapp.com) extension, it’s
mostly a project template and distributed as such. Installation is as easy as:

`git clone http://github.com/balthisar/middlemac.git middlemac_demo`

Then `cd` into the `middlemac_demo` folder, and:


### Update gems (including _Middleman_ if needed)

Gems are Ruby programs and extensions. From within your project directory,
simply:

`bundle install`

This will cause several Ruby gems to begin downloading and install.


### If gem install fails on Mac OS X because of json problems

Try repeating the above using this command, instead:

`ARCHFLAGS=-Wno-error=unused-command-line-argument-hard-error-in-future bundle install`

The reasons are complex but if you really want to know, remember: Google is your
friend.


### Start the _Middleman_ server

From the terminal, use _Middlemac_ to start the _Middleman_ server using our
`free` target:

`./middlemac.rb --server free`


### Open the site in your browser

Simply open the `middlemac.webloc` file from Finder to view the project results
in your default browser.

Or you prefer to open the help site manually, you can go to
[http://localhost:4567/Resources/Base.lproj/](http://localhost:4567/Resources/Base.lproj/)
