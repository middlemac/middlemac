“Absolute” Paths
----------------

When using Middleman's helpers, absolute paths will be converted to relative
paths during the build. Absolute paths are relative to the `Contents (source)`
directory and _not_ the filesystem root.

In general it’s _not_ recommended to use absolute paths unless you need assets
outside of Middleman's configuration. Middleman will automatically build the
correct path using only the asset name when you use its helpers, if the assets
are in the correct directories (e.g., images in `images`).

However you will use absolute paths to refer to items in the `shared` directory
since this it outside of Middleman's normal search scope. The view templates
use this approach, for example.
