==============================

<%= current_page.data.blurb %>

_Middleman_ has several useful, built-in helpers documented on its 
[web site](http://middlemanapp.com/basics/helpers/). These are some of the most
common ones you will use.

`link_to`

 : This helper greatly simplifies links when you’re not able or willing to use
   Markdown links.
   
   `link_to 'Content text', 'http://example.com'`
   
   Will produce
    
   `<a href="http://example.com">Content text</a>`.
   
   You can even use a _Middleman_ resource for the second parameter:
   
   `link_to 'Main Page', current_page.breadcrumbs.first`
   
   And you can specify one or more attributes like so:
   
   `link_to 'test', '#', :title => 'test' , :'data-test' => 'data attribute test'`
   

`image_tag`

 : This helper simplifies adding images to your documents. It knows the location
   of your images if you’ve followed the conventions.
   
   `image_tag 'my_image.png`
   
   You can also specify attributes:
   
   `image_tag 'my_image.png', :alt => 'A murder of crows', :title => 'Birds'


`content_for`

 : The built-in templates include an area for “See Also” where you might want to
   include links in addition to the automatically generated links. You can do
   this with the `contentfor` helper.
   
   ~~~ erb
   <%% content_for :seeAlso do %>
   <%%= link_to 'Some interesting site', 'http://example.com' %>
   <%% end %>
   ~~~

   As you get more advanced with your use of _Middleman_, you will certainly
   think of more uses for this.
