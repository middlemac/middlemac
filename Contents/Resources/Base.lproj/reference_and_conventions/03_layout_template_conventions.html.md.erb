Files
-----

None of these files become standalone HTML documents, and as such should have
a single `.erb` or `.haml` extension.

For organization, the convention is to name HTML containers with a `layout`
prefix and visual templates with a `template` prefix.

 - `layout-html4.haml` - This is just an HTML 4.01 wrapper template and if you
   follow all of the conventions there's nothing you should have to change
   here.

 - `layout-xhtml.haml` - Apple's help landing page (the main page) is
   supposed to be an XHTML 1.0 Strict document. If you follow all of the
   conventions there's nothing you should have to change here.

 - `template-logo-large.haml` - This visual template is suitable for “main”-like
   pages. If you follow conventions you should not have to change anything here.

 - `template-logo-medium.erb`  and `template-logo-small.erb` are other
    additional visual templates. If you follow the image conventions there is
    no reason you should have to modify these templates.
