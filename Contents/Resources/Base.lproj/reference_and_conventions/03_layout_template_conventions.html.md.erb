Files in `layouts`
------------------

None of these files become standalone HTML documents, and as such should have
a single `.erb` or `.haml` extension.

For organization, the convention is to name HTML containers with a `layout`
prefix and visual templates with a `template` prefix.

Per convention _actual_ file extensions in the list below have been left off.

- `layout-html4` - This is just an HTML 4.01 wrapper template and if you
  follow all of the conventions there's nothing you should have to change
  here, unless you’re unhappy with the default [breadcrumbs][03_breadcrumbs].

- `layout-xhtml` - Apple's help landing page (the main page) is
  supposed to be an XHTML 1.0 Strict document. If you follow all of the
  conventions there's nothing you should have to change here.

- `template-logo-large` - This visual template is suitable for “main”-like
  pages. If you follow conventions you should not have to change anything here.

- `template-logo-medium`  and `template-logo-small` are other
   additional visual templates. If you follow the image conventions there is
   no reason you should have to modify these templates.
