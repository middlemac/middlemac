==============================

<%= current_page.data.blurb %>

While it’s true that an Apple Helpbook is simply a glorified web site, there
are details that are required to be satisfied in order to make them work with
your Mac OS X applications. Luckily _Middlemac_ takes care of most of these
details for you.


CFBundleName and Targets
------------------------

The first thing we need to do is come up with a `CFBundleName` for our help
projects, and decide what the targets are going to be. This will help us setup
XCode shortly.

XCode doesn’t know or care what the help bundle’s `CFBundleName` is, but
_Middlemac_ uses it and the target to name the final, built help bundle, and
XCode _does_ have to know the name of those.

All of your targets will share the same `CFBundleName`, so it should be
descriptive of all of your targets adn related to your product name. If the
examples on this page, we’ll use `Middlemac`. This project also has the targets
`pro` and `free`. What this means is _Middlemac_ will build help bundles named
`Middlemac (pro).help` and `Middlemac (free).help`.

Let’s use this information and start to setup XCode.


XCode Configuration
-------------------

### Add Files 

Let’s first tell your XCode targets that the help bundle files are available. In
your XCode project, create folders named `Middlemac (pro).help` and `Middlemac
(free).help`. They typically go into your project’s `Resources` folder. Mac OS
will automatically display them as bundles. For now, these are just proxies for
the bundles we’ll build later.

Next you can add these files to XCode the usual way (“Add files…”). **Make sure
you add these by creating folder references. This is critical.**

Just in case the bold sentence wasn’t reminder enough: make sure you select the
option to create folder references when adding files.

Assuming you have a Pro and Free target in XCode, you can use the file inspector
to make sure the Pro `.help` and the Free `.help` have the appropriate, obvious
target memberships.

### Configure your applications’ `Info.plist` files

If you have multiple XCode targets, you may be using a different `Info.plist`
file for each target. If not, then you’ll have to start because they contain
information unique to each helpbook.
 
Alternatively you can setup an `Info.plist` pre-processor (this is my preferred
approach) that generates an `Info.plist` for each target when you build.
_That’s_ beyond the scope of this document, though. You can begin by looking at
your XCode targets’ **Build Settings -> Packaging**.
{:.note}

In each of your `Info.plist` files, find or create the following keys:

`Help Book directory name` (XCode name)
`CFBundleHelpBookFolder` (raw key name)

 : Ensure you use the appropriate `Middlemac (pro).help` or
   `Middlemac (free).help`, depending on which target’s `.plist` this is.

`Help Book identifier` (XCode name)
`CFBundleHelpBookName` (raw key name)

 : This must match the unique `CFBundleID` that you set for each of your
   help targets in the help project’s `config.rb` file. If you’ve not setup
   the `config.rb` yet, now is a good time to decide on the keys that you will
   use. 
   
   This sample project uses `com.balthisar.middlemac.free.help` and
   `com.balthisar.middlemac.pro.help`.


Setup `config.rb` and especially `options.Help_Output_Location`
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Next make sure you [setup `config.rb`][05_config_rb_reference] with matching
values from above.

We setup empty proxy `.help` bundles for XCode above. Make sure that you set
your `config.rb`’s `options.Help_Output_Location` to the directory that you
created the proxy files. Then, any time you build your help projects with
_Middlemac_, they will be ready to go in XCode automatically, the next time you
build your XCode project.


_Middlemac_ takes care of everything else
-----------------------------------------

Once your `config.rb` is setup, _Middlemac_ takes care of setting all of the
required keys and data in all of the help bundle `.plist`, `.strings`, and
main `index.html` file, managing them for each target.
