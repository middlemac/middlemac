Acknowledgements
----------------
_Middlemac_ depends entirely on [_Middleman_](http://middlemanapp.com), without
which this work would not be practical.

We have chosen the name _Middlemac_ in homage to _Middleman_ and this choice
should not be inferred to mean that this project is related to _Middleman_.

We have designed a logo very similar to that of the _Middleman_ project. It
should not be inferred that _Middlemac_ is related to the _Middleman_ project
based on this design choice. We will happily change to logo if anyone from the
official _Middleman_ project makes such a request.

_Middleman_ itself depends on a whole ecosystem of free and open source
software. Please [visit http://middlemanapp.com](http://middlemanapp.com) in
order to have a full understanding of all of the pieces that make _Middlemac_
work. Without all of these contributions, _Middleman_ and _Middlemac_ would not
be possible.
