==============================

<%= current_page.data.blurb %>


Demonstration
--------------
<% if target_name?(:pro) %>
You are reading this helpbook using the `:pro` target. You can try rebuilding
the project or starting the server with the `:free` target to get a different
result.
<% end %>
<% if target_name?(:free) %>
You are reading this helpbook using the `:free` target. You can try rebuilding
the project or starting the server with the `:pro` target to get a different
result.
<% end %>


How did this work?
------------------
The source file uses a simple conditional and helper to display content based on
the target name. Here’s the (nearly) exact code that was used:

~~~ erb
<%% if target_name?(:pro) %>
You are reading this helpbook using the `:pro` target. You can try rebuilding
the project or starting the server with the `:free` target to get a different
result.
<%% end %>
<%% if target_name?(:free) %>
You are reading this helpbook using the `:free` target. You can try rebuilding
the project or starting the server with the `:pro` target to get a different
result.
<%% end %>
~~~

Why “nearly” exact code? If you examine the `.md.erb` file you will see how to
escape ERB delimiters so that ERB doesn’t try to process them as Ruby code.
In order to display `<%% %>` it is necessary to specify `<%%% %>` in code
blocks. And of course you can read about code blocks and other Markdown
formatting on
[kramdown’s documentation site](http://kramdown.gettalong.org/documentation.html).
