==============================

<%= current_page.data.blurb %>

Breadcrumbs by defeault appear on every page of your help file, except for the
main landing page (which, as root, has no breadcrumb trail).

There are two partials that can each produce the breadcrumbs widget that’s at
the top:
 
`breadcrumbs`
 : Produces breadcrumbs ending with the title of the current page. 
 
`breadcrumbs-alt`
 : Produces breadcrumbs with “Current page” at the end instead of the title of
   the current page.

The partial is included in the `layout-html4` layout file. You can edit this
file to change the type of breadcrumbs widget, or even eliminate it entirely
(since there’s currently not a switch that will do so).
