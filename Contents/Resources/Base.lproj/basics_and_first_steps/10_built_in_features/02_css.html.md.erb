The included CSS is critical for ensuring that the templates work, but they also
serve to provide a recent Apple-like look and feel to your helpbooks. The list
below briefly describes the contents of the `assets/stylesheets` directory.

`font-awesome/*` (directory)
 : The files here provide you the ability to use the icons in the font provided
   by the [font-awesome](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) project.
   You can review their documentation if you’d like to include these easy to
   use images in your project. This documentation uses icons in the navigator
   buttons.
   
`_apple_helpbook.scss`
 : This file contains all of the real styling for _Middlemac_ helpbooks. This
   should be the first place you check for making desired changes.
   
   Note that this `.scss` file will be processed but not output to the build
   directory because it starts with an underscore.
 
`_github.css`
 : Note that this `.css` file will not output to the build directory because it
   starts with an underscore.

`_image_widths.scss`
 : This file is generated by _Middlemac_ every time you build or start the
   server. It consists of a CSS rule that sets a maximum width of images to the
   native size of that image so that strange scaling doesn’t occur. This can
   save time by not having to specify fixed image widths and heights for images
   you may want to use.
   
   If you consider that the CSS rule is written as, for example,
   `img[src$='breadcrumb-separator.png'] { max-width: 7px; }`, there’s a small
   possibility of image name collision.
   
   Note that this `.scss` file will be processed but not output to the build
   directory because it starts with an underscore.

`_normalize.scss`
 : Although _Middlemac_ is intended to build Apple Helpbooks, its content can
   be viewed in web browsers, too. Therefore for convenience, this standard
   normalize file will help ensure that your content looks nearly the same in
   any modern, popular browser.
 
   Note that this `.scss` file will be processed but not output to the build
   directory because it starts with an underscore.

`breadcrumb-separator-light.png`
 : This image is used by CSS to provide a separator between breadcrumb items.
   It’s not out of place being in a stylesheets directory.

`style.css.scss`
 : _This_ file, when compiled to CSS, is the only file that will actually be
   copied to the build project, and the only file that will be loaded by your
   pages. It simply `@include`’s the pertinent files above and bundles them into
   a single file.
