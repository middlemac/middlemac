==============================

_Resources_ in _Middleman_-speak generally refers to pages in _Middleman_’s
internal site-map. As Ruby objects, resources have a lot of useful information
about them.

Note: there’s a lot you can do with _Middlemac_ without manipulating or using
resources directly. The _Middlemac_ framework does a lot of this manipulation
for you. There’s nothing in this documentation helpbook, for example, that uses
features not provided by the conventions.
