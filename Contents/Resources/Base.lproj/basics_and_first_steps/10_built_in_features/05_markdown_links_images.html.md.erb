<%= current_page.data.title %>
==============================

<%= current_page.data.blurb %>

You’ll notice (as you look at the source files for this help content) that the
first ERB instructions immiedately after the headmatter are:

~~~ erb
<%%= partial 'markdown-links' %>
<%%= partial 'markdown-images' %>
~~~

These convenience partials make it relatively simply to include Markdown links
and images using the reference format.
 
Links
-----

~~~ erb
[all help content][all_help_content]
~~~

…will generate the following link:

[all help content][all_help_content]

This is especially useful if your page source filenames stay constant, which is
a risk if you use filename prefixes to set page order.

The reference name will always be the base name of the source file. For index
files, the format will be `groupname_index`, where the groupname is the name of
the containing directory, as you should already know.

You should strive to use unique filenames if you use this feature, for
obvious reasons.

Images
------

Markdown also supports a reference format for images. It looks like this:

~~~ erb
![this is alt tag content][icon_32x32@2x]
~~~

And will generate this:

![this is alt tag content][icon_32x32@2x]
