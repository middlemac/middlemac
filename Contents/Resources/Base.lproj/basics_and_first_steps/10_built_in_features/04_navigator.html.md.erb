==============================

<%= current_page.data.blurb %>

Near the bottom of this page you can see the navigator. It’s visible because
this page’s parent `index.html` file includes `navigate: true` in its
frontmatter.

Setting `:navigate` in the frontmatter will cause all pages with an
[order][09_groups_overview] to display the navigator. This can be overridden
on a page-per-page basis by using the `:navigator` frontmatter key, e.g.,
`navigator: false`.

The partial `prev_next` provides the navigator structure, and the appearance is
set in CSS.
