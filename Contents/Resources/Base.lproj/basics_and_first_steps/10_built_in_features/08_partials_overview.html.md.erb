==============================

<%= current_page.data.blurb %>

_Middlemac_ comes with several partials that it uses to provide a structured,
easy to use framework for generating Apple Helpbooks. You can use these partials
yourself, too, modify them to suit your preferences, and create new ones.

The included partials are mostly functional, but you can also make partials for
other content that you use repeatedly throughout your project.

Note that all partials source filenames are prefixed with an underscore, and
they also don’t have an `.html` extension. Partials will be included in your
content pages; we don’t want _Middleman_ to output them into the build
directory!

Included partials
-----------------

Note: because partials are included with the `partial` helper without the
leading underscore and extension, by convention they are mentioned in this
documentation without these decorations, too.

`breadcrumbs` and `breadcrumbs-alt`
 : These (two variations) render the breadcrumbs widget at the top of the 
   window.

`brethren`
 : This partial renders a `<dl>` with link and blurb for all sibling pages that
   have a sort order and are allowed by the current target and features
   settings.

`help_map` and `help_map_inner`
 : Renders a site-map style index starting at `current_page` or at a passed-in
   resource.
   
   Note: partials can be passed parameter-like local variables using this
   syntax: `partial 'help_map_inner', :locals => { :start => p }`  
   The key-values in the passed-in hash become available as a variables having
   values.

`legitimate_children`
 : Renders a `<dl>` with link and blurb for all legitimate children, i.e.,
   children that have a sort order and are allowed by the current target and
   features settings.

`markdown-images`
 : Convenience reference links for all project images.

`markdown-links`
 : Convenience reference links for all project pages.

`prev_next`
 : This partial renders the navigation widget on pages that have it enabled.

`related_topics`
 : This partial renders the “Related Topics” `<ul>`’s that each of the page
   templates can use.
