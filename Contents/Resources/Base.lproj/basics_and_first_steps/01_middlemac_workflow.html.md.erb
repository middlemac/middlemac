Setup your help project
-----------------------

All of the setup required takes place in a single section of a single Ruby
script. Don’t worry! You don’t have to know Ruby. If you’re a software developer
already it will be painless for you to configure _Middlemac_ to your
applications’ exact specifications.

You will find that most of _Middlemac_’s ease-of-use comes from the conventions
you will follow.


Develop your help structure
---------------------------

Following _Middlemac_’s conventions you will make groups, use tables of contents, and
implement navigation with very little effort. Simply put some types of files where
_Middlemac_ expects to find them and the build system will take care of the
rest.


Develop your help content
-------------------------

All you have to do is write some HTML, or better yet,
[Markdown](http://kramdown.gettalong.org/).


Build your HelpBook
-------------------

From your help project directory, a single Terminal command can build one, more
or all of your targets, with as much or little on-screen feedback as you want.
In a matter of seconds to minutes (based on your project size), _Middlemac_ will
build your targets anywhere you’ve setup.
 
If you target your application’s XCode project directory (and have already
configured XCode to use your `.help` bundle, then all that’s left is to…


Build your application
----------------------

And then run it. And start your help. It’s that easy.
