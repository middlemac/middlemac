Middlemac workflow
------------------

The _Middlemac_ workflow is what makes it easy to build Apple HelpBooks compared
to traditional methods.

# Setup your help project

All of the setup required takes place in a single section of a single Ruby
script. Don’t worry! You don’t have to know Ruby. If you’re a software developer
already it will be painless for you to configure _Middlemac_ to your
applications’ exact specifications.

You will find that most of _Middlemac_’s ease-of-use comes from the conventions
you will follow.

# Develop your help content

Following _Middlemac_’s conventions will make sections, tables of contents, and
navigation effortless to implement. Simply put some types of files where
_Middlemac_ expects to find them, and the build system will take care of the
rest. All you have to do is write some HTML, or better yet, Markdown.

# Build your HelpBook

From your help project directory, a single Terminal command can build one, more
or all of your targets, with as much or little on-screen feedback as you want.
In a matter of seconds to minutes (based on your project size), _Middlemac_ will
build your targets anywhere you’ve setup. If you target your application’s
XCode project directory (and have already configured XCode to use your `.help`
bundle, then all that’s left is to…

# Build your application

And then run it. And start your help. It’s that easy.
