title:  Configure your help project
blurb:  You will configure your helpbook project in <code>config.rb</code>,
        which will specify the settings that <em>Middlemac</em> uses to build
        one or more valid Apple Helpbooks.

==============================

<%= current_page.data.blurb %>

The file `config.rb` has settings which both affect how _Middleman_ operates as
well as how _Middlemac_ builds your helpbooks. **If you follow the _Middlemac_
conventions, there should be no reason to change the _Middleman_ settings.**

When you open `config.rb` in your text editor, near the top you will readily
identify the start of the _Middlemac_ configuration block, which is delimited
by this block at the beginning:

~~~ ruby
################################################################
# Configuration. Change the option values to suit your needs.
################################################################
~~~

And terminated by this block at the end:

~~~ ruby
################################################################
# STOP! There's nothing below here that you should have to
# change. Just follow the conventions and framework provided.
################################################################
~~~

This file is very well documented, and as such not much is to be gained by
repeating its content here, although much more information is available in
the [reference section][05_config_rb_reference].
