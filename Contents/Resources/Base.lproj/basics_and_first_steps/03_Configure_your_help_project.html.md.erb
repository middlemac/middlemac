The file `config.rb` has settings which both affect how _Middleman_ operates as
well as how _Middlemac_ builds your helpbooks. **If you follow the _Middlemac_
conventions, there should be no reason to change the _Middleman_ settings.**

When you open `config.rb` in your text editor, near the top you will readily
identify the start of the _Middlemac_ configuration block, which is delimited
by this block at the beginning:

~~~ ruby
################################################################
# Configuration. Change the option values to suit your needs.
################################################################
~~~

And terminated by this block at the end:

~~~ ruby
################################################################
# STOP! There's nothing below here that you should have to
# change. Just follow the conventions and framework provided.
################################################################
~~~

This file is very well documented, and as such not much is to be gained by
repeating its content here. Some points of explanation are in order, however.

`options.Target = (ENV['HBTARGET'] || :pro).to_sym`
  : In general you should use `middlemac` in the terminal instead of using
    `middleman` or `bundle exec` directly. However if you choose to use them,
    then know that you must specify a target with the HBTARGET environment
    variable, or use the default target specified by this setting. The default,
    `:pro` in this example, can be built using `middleman build` or
    `bundle exec middleman build` without specifying an environment variable.
    Or, as recommended, simply use `middlemac` instead.
    
`options.CFBundleName = 'Middlemac'`
  : The `CFBundleName` is one of the pieces of data that link your Mac OS X
    application to its help file. It is intended to be the same for all of your
    help targets. _Middlemac_ will use this value to configure the help system
    for your targets automatically.
    
`options.Help_Output_Location = nil`
  : When you build your targets, they will be placed into the directory
    specified by this setting. The default, `nil`, will put builds into your
    project directory.
    
    We recommend that you set the output location to the location that XCode
    expects to find your `.help` bundles, so that whenever you build your
    XCode targets the latest-built help will always be included.

`Targets`
  : The `Targets` hash contains all of the settings for each of your build
    targets. The _Middlemac_ documentation consists of a `free` and a `pro`
    target for demonstration purposes. Most of the fields are self-explanatory,
    but there’s some mention of `CFBundleID` and `Features` below.
    
`CFBundleID`
  : Each help target must have a unique `CFBundleID` that matches a unique
    `CFBundleHelpBookName` in your applications’ `Info.plist` files. This
    pairing is the mechanism by which Mac OS X knows which help bundle belongs
    to which application. If they are not unique, Mac OS X _will_ become
    confused, and you end-users, if they have multiple versions of your product
    install will not be very satisfied.
    
`ProductName` and `ProductURI`
  : The default templates use these in a prominent way, and they’re also
    available to you using [_Middlemac_’s helpers][01_middleman_helpers].
 
`Features`
  : Aside from **targets** the use of **features** can give you fine-grained
    control over what content appears in each target. It’s considered a 
    best-practice to include all of the same features in the hash for each
    target, and specify a boolean (true/false) value for each key, as
    appropriate for your target. _Middlemac_ documentation has four features
    defined, and we will [look at examples later][08_features_overview].
