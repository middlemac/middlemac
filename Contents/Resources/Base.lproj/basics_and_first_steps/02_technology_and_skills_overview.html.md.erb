==============================

_Middlemac_ uses tools you may already know, or may not know: 

- _Middleman_ is a static HTML site generator, and is the heart of _Middlemac_’s
  abilities, as well as an inspiration for the name.
- Ruby is language that _Middlemac_, _Middlemac_, and much of the others tools
  are written with. _You do not have to learn Ruby to take advantage of
  *Middlemac*_.
- helpbook.rb is the extension to _Middleman_ that makes it effortlessly build
  Apple HelpBooks. It’s also the command-line tool that makes it easier to work
  with Middleman.
- HTML is the markup language that Apple requires for HelpBooks. But _Middlemac_
  promises to make things easy for you, and so…
- Markdown is the text-based, human-readable, easy to use format that will
  make writing your documentation a real pleasure. This file is written using
  Markup.
