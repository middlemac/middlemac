_Middleman_ is a [static site generator using all the shortcuts and tools in
modern web development](http://middlemanapp.com). It was intended to have been
a tool to create static websites with most of the dynamism of websites running
on technologies such as PHP and Ruby on Rails. Static websites are fast and
secure.

Apple Helpbooks, in their essence, are static websites. 

_Middleman_ with the help of _Middlemac_ is the perfect tool in your help file
development toolchain.

Builder _and_ server
--------------------
_Middleman_ doesn’t merely build final output; it includes a non-configuration
server that makes it much easier to develop your website or helpbook. Features
such as live reload mean that when you change your source file, the site in
your web browser will update automatically.

The server captures changes to most of your source files. However if you make
changes to `config.rb`, you will have to restart the server.


Basic concepts
--------------
_Middleman_’s basic concepts are these:

- Organize your site in a source directory that mirrors the desired structure
  on the server (or in our case, in our helpbook).
- Add file extensions to the source files to indicate the type of pre-processing
  that you want to perform on each of them.
- Provide the ability to include partials and use helpers to improve your
  content development productivity.
- Provide the ability to use templates and layouts to bring uniformity to your
  website (in our case, to your helpbook).
- Act as a server in developer mode, building content dynamically as you develop
  it.
- Build final output, ready to use wherever you need it.


You can use _Middleman_ directly
--------------------------------
_Middlemac_ is an extension and project template for _Middleman_. As such, you
can ignore _Middlemac_’s command line tool that abstracts some of how
_Middleman_ works, and use _Middleman_ directly.

`middleman build` (or `bundle exec middleman build`) will build the default
target specified in `config.rb`.

`HBTARGET=target middleman build` (or `HBTARGET=target bundle exec middleman build`)
will build the target specified by _target_.

`middleman` will start the server using the default target.

`HBTARGET=target middleman` will start the server using the specified _target_.
