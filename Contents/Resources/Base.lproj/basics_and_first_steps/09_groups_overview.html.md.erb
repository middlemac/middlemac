==============================



Groups
------

- A GROUP is a bunch of files in a directory at a single level.
- A GROUP landing-page should begin with 000_
- Using the table_contents partial will include a TOC for all files at this
  group level except for 000_ files.
- Can include another group's toc by specifying a :group in locals, where the
  GROUP is really just the directory name.
- WANT to include a gather_toc, which looks in the top level of all of the
  directories at the current level to look for 000_ files. Build a list with
  blurbs.
