What are groups?
----------------

A Group is one of more files in a single level of directory, and also any
`index.html` file of immediate subdirectories of the group.

Group directories require one file that will compile into `index.html` file in
that directory, e.g., `index.html.md.erb`. This file _is not part of the group_;
it serves as the _parent_ to the group. The files in the group are all 
_children_ of the `index.html` file. Each file in the group is a _sibling_ of
the other files in the group.

Groups are named based on their containing directory. The highest level group is
`Base.lproj` and cannot be changed. Group names are generally not user-facing,
and the Apple Help system requires this directory name, so don’t worry about it.

Example:

~~~
Base.lproj/
  index.html
  introduction.html
  basics/
    index.html
    counters.html
~~~

The `Base.lproj` consists of two pages: `introduction.html`, and
`basics/index.html`. The highest-level `index.html` is the parent of this
group.

Groups can be nested to arbitrary levals.


Page order in groups
--------------------

Using the included [partials][08_partials_reference], you can design tables of
contents, related pages, indices, etc., for groups with a single line of code.
In addition _Middlemac_ includes built-in navigation widgets for groups, should
you like to use them.

Group member’s sort/navigation order is determined two ways. Files in the group
can have an `:order` key in the frontmatter, or the first three digits of the
filename can specify a sort order, e.g., `004`, or `23_`. If both are present,
the `:order` key takes precedence. If two pages end up with the same sort order,
then the actual behavior is undefined. Parent `index.html` files cannot be
prefixed, and so must include an `:order` key in their frontmatter.
 
Pages without a sort order are _not_ present in any of the automatic navigation
or contents partials. This is by design. You can still link to them, however.

Prefixing file names can be convenient so that source files are sorted in your
file system the same way they will be displayed in your help system. Keep in
mind, though, that if you’re using the automatic markdown links from the
`_markdown-links.erb` partial, and change the order via filename, all of the
links in your existing documents will become invalid.
