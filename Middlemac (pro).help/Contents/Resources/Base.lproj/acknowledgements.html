        <p><em>Middlemac</em> depends entirely on <a href="http://middlemanapp.com"><em>Middleman</em></a>, without
        which this work would not be practical.</p>
        
        <p>We have chosen the name <em>Middlemac</em> in homage to <em>Middleman</em> and this choice
        should not be inferred to mean that this project is related to <em>Middleman</em>.</p>
        
        <p>We have designed a logo very similar to that of the <em>Middleman</em> project. It
        should not be inferred that <em>Middlemac</em> is related to the <em>Middleman</em> project
        based on this design choice. We will happily change to logo if anyone from the
        official <em>Middleman</em> project makes such a request.</p>
        
        <p><em>Middleman</em> itself depends on a whole ecosystem of free and open source
        software. Please <a href="http://middlemanapp.com">visit http://middlemanapp.com</a> in
        order to have a full understanding of all of the pieces that make <em>Middlemac</em>
        work. Without all of these contributions, <em>Middleman</em> and <em>Middlemac</em> would not
        be possible.</p>

        <em>Middlemac</em> depends on other components in order to work. Those components are
        <em>not</em> distributed with <em>Middlemac</em> and have their own licences which the authors
        of <em>Middlemac</em> do not pretend to override.</p>
